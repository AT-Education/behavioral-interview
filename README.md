## 1.16. A note on managing managers and role of SEM(or EM2)

- Due to having a much broader scope and more visibility to various parts of the organization, senior EMs are in a better position to ensure that teams have the right privatizations. 
- They generally also don't have emotional attachments toward individual projects and can make unbiased decisions more easily than EM1s
- They empower the managers they support and trust them to make the right decisions for their teams and the projects they have been assigned, only guiding them in necessary situations.
- They support multiple teams and should be able to evaluate the performance of teams and individuals.
- They need to know when to transition an IC to a manager.

#### 1.16.0.1. Helping an EM1 to grow

1. You may help EM1s in people support and project management. While coaching them, it is preferable to give them ideas instead of dictating the exact process.
2. For senior EM1s who have potential, you must gradually grow them to senior EMs. You can help them to grow their teams and attain the skills required for senior EMs.
3. You may have to help the EM1s when they lack bandwidth.
4. You can also help them grow by finding leadership training for them, which will help them develop and polish their skills.

#### 1.16.0.2. Supporting an under performing team

- The most important step to handling an under performing team is finding the root cause of the performance issues.
- Identify the strategy and plan for actions with your respective EM1. This action is significant because it portrays a senior EM's decision-making skills.
- The team will need to take action to resolve the issue

#### 1.16.0.3. Organizational restructuring

##### 1.16.0.3.1. Causes

- Organic growth
- Change in priorities from senior leadership
- End of some product

##### 1.16.0.3.2. Challenges

- ICs change of team or manager, with IC feeling drop in trust
- Product support and business continuity
- **Stakeholder engagements** : onboard stakeholders before announcement 
- **Rumours and panics** : keep reorg decisions confidential for as long as possible. Changes should only be announced when every stakeholder is on board and should subsequently be executed without delays

## 1.18. Q. How do you do costing and budgeting for your team?

Costing and budgeting are two separate but related activities. 
Costing is where you estimate how much time a project will take to complete. 
Budgeting is how you will manage available engineering bandwidth for the project.

### 1.18.1. Costing

- The core idea behind costing is breaking down the project into smaller components that will allow you to make a rough estimate.
- Breaking user stories to high level tech stories/tasks
- looking for XFN dependencies
- calculating risk
- t-shirt sizing based on Size, Complexity,Unknowns, Risk (SCUR)
- Calculate total squad months
- Include buffer

### 1.18.2. Budgeting

- identify work-streams
- ask each TLs work-streams they are interested in
- ask each individual which work-streams they are interested in
- you have to choose project owners based on skill match and priority

## 1.19. Mission Vision and Strategy

- **Mission**: purpose of the team. ex: "to provide a unified workflow platform for mortgage team" 
- **Vision**: What you want to accomplish in next 12-24 months
- **Strategy**: High level steps taken or direction to achieve the goals of their vision statement

### 1.19.1. Your role as an EM to build strategy

**Mission Statement**: _"To create a unified, automated workflow platform that empowers banks to streamline their mortgage processes, enhance operational efficiency, and deliver exceptional customer experiences"_
**Vision statement**: _"To be the industry-leading provider of innovative mortgage workflow solutions, enabling banks to achieve operational excellence, reduce costs, and drive growth"_

For strategy, get involved in decisions on following, with documented decisions/ADRs:

- tech stack
- architecture
- portfolio lifecycle from PoC -> skateboard modelling -> MVP -> project -> platform -> retire
- project milestones and scope for each milestone
- development methodology - Agile/scrum/waterfall etc
- devops practices
- Team topology: XFN, roles and responsibilities
- decisions on NFR
- release management strategies (dark release etc)
- Cadence of ceremonies like sprint duration, project retrospective
- Quality assurance frameworks
- Definition of success as per SMART team goals (eg: API quality score should be at least 90%, p99 for all API response should be <1s)
- metrics and analytics
- ITSM and BCM

## 1.20. Q. Give an example of a project that failed despite the effort and passion that went into it

example of supply chain management, and how purchase order processing failed for large customers.

- Issue with buy-in from all stake holders on nature of files
- Issue with buy-in suppliers with common understanding of delivery timelines in writing
- under-estimation of technical complexities
- not selecting "buy-over-build" principle
- hyper care/stability buffer between actual production release and opening to customer on first version
